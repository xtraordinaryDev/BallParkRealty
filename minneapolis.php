<p>Hennepin County's seat is in Minneapolis, and the city itself is Minnesota's largest. There are 13 lakes, marshes, the Mississippi River, and the city is adjacent to Saint Paul, Minnesota, all of which provide plentiful water.</p>

<p>The population is projected to reach 425,336 by the year 2021. It has more people than any other city in the state and ranks 46th in the country. The term "Twin Cities" refers to both Minneapolis and Saint Paul as well as the neighboring metropolitan area.</p>

Biking and walking trails, some of which follow abandoned railroad lines, run through many parts of the city, including the Mill District around the banks of Lake of the isles, Bde Maka Ska, and Lake Harriot, and by Minnehaha Falls. Minneapolis has one of the most extensive public park systems in the United States. The climate in Minneapolis varies greatly from season to season, with snowy winters and hot, muggy summers.</p>

<p>The Twins of baseball, the Vikings of football, the Lynx of women's basketball, the Timberwolves of men's basketball, and the Wild of ice hockey, together with the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers, all call Minneapolis home. The United States Bank Stadium, which hosted the xGames in 2017 and 2018 as well as the Super Bowl in 2018 and the Final Four tournament of NCAA men's collegiate basketball in 2019, is just one of several significant venues that gather ardent spectators year-round.</p>

The Walker Art Center is the most popular modern art museum in the United States, and it features a wide range of exhibitions, performances, talks, and films. Minneapolis has more theaters per person than any other city except New York City. The Guthrie Theatre, winner of a Tony Award, the Orpheum Theatre, home to Broadway shows, and the Minnesota Orchestra and Minnesota Opera are all excellent options. The Mill City Museum is located in a restored flour mill on the banks of the Mississippi River and provides a glimpse into the city's past. Both ancient artifacts dating back 40,000 years and contemporary works of art are on display at the Minneapolis Institute of Art.</p>
