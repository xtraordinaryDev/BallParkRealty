    <p>In Hennepin County, Minnesota, on the north bank of the Minnesota River, Bloomington is a suburban city with a population of 89,987, ranking it as the fourth-largest city in Minnesota as of the 2020 Census.</p>

<p>With two significant motorways serving it, Bloomington was built as a post-World War II housing boom suburb connected to Minneapolis' metropolitan street network. Along the I-494 corridor, there is a lot of large-scale commercial development. Bloomington has a large city park system with more than 1,000 square feet (93 m2) of parkland per person. It is also home to Hyland Lake Park Reserve in the west and MN Valley National Wildlife Refuge in the southeast.</p>

<p>Partially thanks to the Mall Of America, the largest enclosed shopping mall in the United States, Bloomington has more jobs per capita than either Minneapolis or Saint Paul. Ceridian, Donaldson Company, HealthPartners, and Toro all have their main offices in the city, as do Pearson, General Dynamics, Seagate Technologies, Express Scripts, and Dairy Queen.</p>

<p>There are a lot of employers in the city, which is home to more than 100,000 jobs. Bloomington is a major center for tourism because it is close to major transportation routes and the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport.</p>

<p>Bloomington is the home of the headquarters for Ceridian, Donaldson Company, the Evangelical Free Church of America, Great Clips, Leeann Chin, HealthPartners, Holiday Stationstores, Highland Bank, Thermo King, and Toro.</p>

<p>There are two big sports complexes in Bloomington. Dred Scott Playfields, which is on the far West side and is named after Dred Scott, has a lot of fun things to do, like baseball, softball, football, sand volleyball, tennis, and basketball. A privately owned outdoor batting cage and a small golf course are also part of the complex. On the East side, Valley View Playfields has softball and baseball fields, courts for bocce ball, and the Bloomington Family Aquatic Center. Bush Lake Beach (BLB), which is on Bush Lake, is open to recreational swimmers in the summer.</p>

<p>Bloomington is home to the shopping mall Mall of America. It is southeast of the intersection of Interstate 494 and Minnesota State Highway 77, north of the Minnesota River, and across Interstate 494 from the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport. It opened in 1992 and is the largest mall in the United States, the largest in the Western Hemisphere, and the ninth largest in the world.</p>

<p>Aside from the Mall, there are more hotels, restaurants, and stores outside of it. In Blooming, the South Loop District is where the Mall of America and other businesses come together.</p>
