 <h2 style="font-size: 25px;">	The City Hall of Lakeville, Minnesota	</h2>
<p>	According to the terms of the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux, signed in 1851, the Sioux ceded the majority of modern-day southern Minnesota. In 1853, Captain William B. Dodd conceived of and directed the building of a road that would link the military outposts in St. Paul and Faribault, and the community of Lakeville was born. In 1858, the area that is now Lakeville was established as Lakeville Township. When the Hastings and Dakota Railroad line was built in 1869, officials tried to buy land at Lakeville to build a depot. After the landowner declined to sell, the railroad constructed a platform, renamed the area "Fairfield," and bought 20 acres of ground located half a mile to the east. The citizens and business owners of Fairfield worked for nine years to change the town's name to Lakeville. Because they sought to separate from Lakeville Township, which covered the surrounding rural area, the residents of Lakeville voted to incorporate as the Village of Lakeville in 1878.	</p>
